# Workout-Tracker

## Description


This application allows users to create and track their daily workouts.  The app tracks the name, type, weights, sets  reps, and duration  of the exercise and tracks the distance traveled for cardio based exercises. You can continue to add exercises on the given day or create a whole new workout. The workout is then saved for that given day.
